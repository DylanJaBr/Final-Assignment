Minor Change: You add a speed boost to the game. While the player is holding down a button, the character moves faster. Which is the shift button.
Major Change: MAJOR MOD: You add a UI element to the game. It is a timer! John Lemon has to reach the end of the level at a certain time or the game ends. You have 30 seconds.
